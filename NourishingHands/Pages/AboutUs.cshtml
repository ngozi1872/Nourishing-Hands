                            Nourishing Hands Inc. is a comprehensive life skills nonprofit organization founded in 2013. The organization serves youth ages 15-24 in Georgia. Through our virtual community and school-based mentoring services.  We partner with families, schools and youth dwelling places in communities to deliver group and one-on-one mentoring sessions. Our program serves through four initiatives: Wellness, Education, Employment, and Financial Literacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The organization’s services are designed to meet the needs that exist between the school counselors, society, and our youth. Ensuring that every youth in Georgia has the opportunity to develop into productive and self-sustaining citizens and leaders of our future. According to the recent US census report (21% of teens live in poverty in Georgia, 40% of Georgia's teen are homeless, 4.7% of teens drop out of high school, 20% of teens 16-19 are unemployed), there is a large number of youth in Georgia who have either dropped out of high school, homeless, unemployed, and lack higher education (college). Our programs are designed to provide the necessary guidance and accountable support for redirecting them as they navigate this critical transitional phase of life.  Nourishing Hands Inc. mission is to provide relevant resources, experiences, and opportunities to youth through mentoring; empowering them for future success.  Since the inception of our organization we’ve served youth and their families on a smaller scale in various public school settings. The conviction to make a broader impact was birthed during our founder’s tenure as an educator within several school districts across Atlanta. Our founder witnessed extremely talented youth with undiscovered talents and no access to opportunities to develop further.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are committed to our vision of developing leaders through a holistic approach of mentoring youth. That commitment is weaved through our holistic and non-traditional methodology to educational counseling, career training and job placement, financial literacy coaching, and the wellbeing of youth. In a recent publication of The Chronicles of Evidence-Based- Mentoring, Harvard professor, Dr. Jean E. Rhodes, article, Older and Wiser: New Ideas for Youth Mentoring in the 21st Century, she writes that most mentoring programs do not focus on what young people need. Organizations typically prioritize building emotional bonds between mentors and mentees. But research makes clear that effective programs emphasize the development of specific social, emotional, and intellectual skills. Our approach is unmatched because we strategically partner with young professionals, corporations, organizations, and elected officials who are as committed as we are, and willing to serve as mentors delivering content from expert experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another study conducted in 2015, found that 52 percent of mentored youth are less likely to skip school. Youth with mentors have increased likelihood of going to college, better attitudes toward school, increased social and emotional development, and improved self-esteem. In addition, we establish partnerships with other organizations with missions and practices that are aligned with ours to ensure our participants needs and concerns are fully addressed through network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an organization, we deliver programs that are proven, researched, and evidence based. Our programs are relevant and crucial in addressing the problem of racial inequality and equity, and social injustice for youth whose fate does not provide such resources and would otherwise be left without hope. We have committed ourselves to being the change agents of our time by ensuring that every youth in Georgia has access to the tools for success.

                    <p>
                        As an immigrant who came to America as a refugee from her war-torn nation of Liberia, Cynthia Logan understands the plight of a young child who finds
                        themselves dodging bullets and walking alongside dead bodies. She knows what it is like to abruptly leave everything while seeking refuge in neighboring
                        countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Cynthia’s family arrived in the United States in the early nineties, their “normal” life had changed. She saw her parents struggle. They could no
                        longer afford to provide basic necessities for their children. Cynthia remembers being denied all forms of public assistance for the first few years in
                        America. Until her family gained immigration status, they found themselves relying on churches, pantries, thrift stores, and organizations to meet their
                        basic needs. Regardless of the reason for a person’s immigrant or refugee status, Cynthia believes the transition weighs heavily on young children than
                        many people realize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cynthia’s family are generations educators, naturally her career path landed her to continue family tradition. After years of hardship and becoming 
                        acclimated to her new environment, she completed requirement for a high school diploma. Understanding that she must acquire advanced education, twelve
                        years after highs school, she pursued her dream of becoming an education and impacting the lives of young people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cynthia has the ability to connect with people seamlessly, especially youth. This ability has opened doors for countless positive interactions with 
                        her students. As a mentor, she helped shaped the lives of the many students she taught. She believes that she has located her life’s purpose, which 
                        is to advocate and be a voice for people who cannot speak for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cynthia is a wife, a mother, Best Selling author, speaker, and an accomplished educator who has taught both General and Special Education students in the United
                        States and abroad. Her students (including Special Education population) achieved satisfactory scores on state and district assessments. After years
                        of teaching and serving students from marginalized communities, she witnessed many negative aspects of poverty. She believes that no child’s education
                        should be stifled by the effects of circumstances beyond their control.
