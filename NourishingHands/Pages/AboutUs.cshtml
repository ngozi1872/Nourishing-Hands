                    <p>As an immigrant who came to America as a refugee from the war-torn nation of Liberia, Cynthia Logan understands the plight of a young child who abruptly leaves everything they have known and found themselves dodging bullets, and walking alongside dead bodies on our journey to seeking refuge into neighboring countries. And later moved to new country thousands of miles away. Regardless of the reason for a person’s immigrant or refugee status, Cynthia believes the transition weighs more heavily on young children than many people realize.</p>

                    <p>Cynthia Logan is an accomplished educator who has taught both General Education and Special Education classrooms in the United States and abroad. Her students (including Special Education population) achieved satisfactory scores on state and district assessments. After years of teaching and serving students from marginalized communities, she witnessed many negative aspects of poverty in the lives of her students. And factors that perpetuate poverty, two of which are, the lack exposure to resources and the absence of committed mentors (specially for teen.)</p>
                    <p>She successfully galvanized friends and co-workers who committed themselves to go beyond the educational curriculum and meet students physical and emotional needs. Their team was tasked with mentoring students into future leader through character development and skill acquisition. The two skills were taught and modeled good citizenship, and creating opportunities for students to connect with professionals helpful in meeting career and educational goals. During those experiences she learned that "I care" and "I love you" are two phrases that transcend every race and boundary, and motivates people to give their personal best every time.</p>
                    <p>Her ability to connect with people, especially teens, and countless interactions as a mentor helped shaped the lives of many young people she taught. Not only were her students impacted, but today she maintains lasting relationships with many of her former students and their families.</p>
